👋 Hi, I’m Nirmal Israel 

👀 I’m interested in software development, with a primary focus on backend technologies and system architecture. I am also skilled in UI/UX design, where I leverage modern web technologies to enhance user experience and create intuitive interfaces.

🌱 I’m currently learning .NET, with a focus on LINQ methods, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I have a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and Automation (REST API). I’m also enhancing my skills in user interface development and working with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MSSQL.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving ASP.NET MVC, WinForms applications, and any opportunity to deepen my expertise in .NET and LINQ. I am also open to contributing to UI/UX design projects and exploring new technologies.
